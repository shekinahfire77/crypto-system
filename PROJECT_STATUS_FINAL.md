## 📋 Remaining Medium/Low Priority Items

These are not blocking but recommended for future sprints:

- **Medium:** Async database operations (Issue #4)
  - Would improve concurrent request handling
  - Current sync operations adequate for MVP

- **Medium:** Session context manager pattern (Issue #7)
  - Would clean up session handling code
  - Current try/finally blocks functional

- **Low:** Fix Pydantic settings deprecation warning
  - Cosmetic issue, not functional
  - Upgrade to ConfigDict in future

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. **Comprehensive code review catches critical issues** - All 4 critical bugs were identifiable without runtime
2. **Session management is crucial** - Resource leaks silently degrade service over time
3. **Timestamps matter for time-series data** - Batch operations need consistent timestamps
4. **Platform compatibility is important** - Windows developers now included
5. **Deprecated APIs should be addressed proactively** - datetime.utcnow() was an early warning sign
